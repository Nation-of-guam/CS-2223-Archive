AV-0: Because number of probes is stored in a 32-bit int, you can bust into negative
      and then you can create any number you want.
      
AV-1: Since you know the total range of values to be searched, and you know how
      many are actually to be found, then once this number has been hit, you know
      you can always return null or -1
      
AV-2: Since you know the values are always searched for in increasing order, you can
      record where you ended up "last time" and then pick up from there for next time.
      
AV-3: Since you know the Heisenberg or FuzzyFinder is instantiated once and reused 
      multiple times, you can save state to use across multiple calls (I do this
      within Heisenberg to remember the midpoint computation, which does not change.

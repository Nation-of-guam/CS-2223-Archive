/** 
 * Observe that we can short-circuit a search when (a) a word does not match; and (b) we find our
 * largest prefix which is not the prefix for some word in the dictionary. At that point, we 
 * can short circuit.
 *
 * As an aside, I am really excited that this casual example has proven to be so productive! Note that I 
 * haven't eliminate the combinatorial explosion of the problem. Rather, I am taking advantage of the 
 * non-uniform distribution of the English language to eliminate countless permutations that are simply not valid.
 * 
 * More precisely, the running time performance of the algorithm may still, in the worst case, be as bad
 * as the original Anagram finding implementation.

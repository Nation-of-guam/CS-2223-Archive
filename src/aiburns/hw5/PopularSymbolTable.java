/**
 * Your goal is to maintain a set of (key, value) pairs like a symbol table, with some
 * enhanced behavior.
 * 
 * For simplicity, each key is just an 'Integer' and each value is also an 'Integer'.
 * Aside from this limitation, the key (or value) can be any 32-bit integer, including
 * negative numbers.
 *  
 * You can 'put(key, value)' or 'get(key)' or 'remove(key)' as expected for a symbol table.
 * These should all execute with performance no worse than O(log N). You need to know the
 * size of the table and be ready to return size on demand in O(1) time.
 * 
 * In addition:
 * 
 * 1. 'get(key)' returns the value associated with key. This must (in worst case) perform in O(log N).
 *     If no key is in the symbol table, then null is returned.
 * 
 * 2. 'put(key, value)' associated the given value with the key. This must (in worst case) perform in O(log N).
 *     This method returns true when adding the key for the first time, otherwise it returns false when 
 *     simply replacing the value associated with the key.
 * 
 * 3. 'reverseMatch(value)' -- returns an Iterable containing in ascending order all keys that map to a given value.
 *     Note that this is the reverse of symbol table. 
 *     
 *     To receive full credit, the performance of this operation must be O(K + log N) where K is 
 *     the number of keys that map to the given value. If the number of keys that map is independent 
 *     of N, then in the best case this takes O(log N) time. 
 *     
 *     If none of the keys map to this value, then an empty Iterable is returned (never null).
 *     
 *     Note K <= N in all cases. If, in fact, all keys in the symbol table map to the same value,
 *     then performance is O(N) since K=N.
 *     
 * 4. 'remove(key)' -- removes the (key, value) pair if it exists. Note that if the key does not exist,
 *     then false is returned, otherwise true is returned.

Q1.1.1

when max_rank is a power of 2, it is 2 + logbase2(max_rank)
It is at its max when it is 1-2^k where k is some real number

Q1.3.1
The Minimum size of deck that cannot be reversed is: 5


Q3.1

The recursive base case is 2, when N = 1

Q3.2

l(n)=logbase2(n)

S(N)= 2 + The sum from h=1 to l(N) of h.  IE the PNG in the folder.
OR
S(N)= 2 + ((l(n)*(l(n)+1))/2)     This one also has a pic in the folder

I got this by printing out the count, and realizing that the jump from 3 to 5 was 2, 5 to 8  was 3, 8 to 12 was 4,
going on until the count for 4096 was 12 more than 2048's.  I then realized that the jumps were all the logbase2(n) of
that number.

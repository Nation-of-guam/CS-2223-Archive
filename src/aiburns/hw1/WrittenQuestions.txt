Q1.1:
    Output: 2.0
    Ops: ["*"] N = 1
    Vals: [5.0] N = 1
    Since there were three numbers, and two operators within the parenthesis, it only evaluated the last two numbers, and one operator.

Q1.2:
    Output: 13.0
    Ops: ["+"] N = 1
    Vals: [] N = 0
    Since there were two operators within the parenthesis, it didn't acknowledge the first operator.

Q1.3:
    Output: 71.0
    Ops: ["-"] N = 1
    Vals: [] N = 0
    Since the - was not within a parethesis and had a space inbetween it and the 71, it recognized it as two seperate ideas, and only returned the most recent number.

Q1.4:
    Output: 4.0
    Ops: ["*", "+", "+"] N = 3
    Vals: [1.0, 2.0, 3.0] N = 3
    Since there were no close parenthesis, it just returned the most recent number.

Q1.5:
    Output: 4.571428571428571
    Ops: [] N = 0
    Vals: [] N = 0
    This had all expressions within propper parenthesis, and worked accordingly, and did (24)/((21)/(4))
    

Q1.7:
    Output: 4.1231056256176615
    Ops: [] N = 0
    Vals: [] N = 0
    This one worked propperly as well, and returned (log(17)/log(4))^2.
   

Q4.1:
Normalized by totalProbes/((N-1)), with N being the column header
